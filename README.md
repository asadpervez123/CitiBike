##Analyzing usage of CitiBikes in New York

On account of the complaints received by customer support about the bike stations of CitiBike 
being empty, a deeper analysis of the data resulted in showing that it is indeed the
case.

11 stations resulted is being completely empty and most of them are in Brooklyn. However,
the bike station at E 17 St & Broadway, which is located in mid-town Manhattan – right next
to Union Square, and holds a capacity of 66 bikes is also empty.

The dataset shows us that the use of the E 17 St & Broadway bike Station peaks at 1pm, and
mostly on the weekdays. The two most popular routes for riders from this station is to W 31
St & 7 Ave and Pershing Square North. W 31st & 7 Ave is the closest to bike stand to the
Penn Station, an Amtrak railway station with trains to other cities. Pershing Square North is
the closest bike station to Grand Central Terminal, one of New York’s oldest, busiest and
most popular commuter rail terminal.

Since both, Penn Station and the Grand Central Terminal work on scheduled train
departures, it stands to reason that our riders intending to board those trains will also try
and rent out bikes on scheduled times. It is approximately a 7 to 8 min ride to both these
locations from E 17 St & Broadway. However, other modes of public transportation such as
buses and the subway can take anywhere from 15min to 30min an would cost the
commuter a minimum of $2.5. For these routes, Citi Bike seem is the shortest and cheapest
commute and hence the most preferred.

Another finding to support the above is that 91% of all commuters on these routes are
‘Subscribed’ users. That is, they have joined our monthly subscription plan indicating that
their usage is frequent and routine.

The top four most popular trips are apparently looping among themselves. With the most
popular being Central Park S & 6 Ave. These riders are not commuters but rather tourists or
regulars who take this ride as part of their routine exercise. This looping ride is also
popularized on both Tripadvisor1 and the Citi Bike website2.

Going by the above observations, it is highly recommended that the bike capacity at E 17 St
& Broadway, Pershing Square North and W 31 St & & Ave are immediately increased or we
may face losing a large monthly subscriber base and thereby face a massive hit on our
monthly revenue.

To add these bikes we can take bikes from the stations less used and usually full. Data shows
that there are such 15 such station with a capacity of 402 bikes.
